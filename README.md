This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## New things learnt

The naming of a new component should start with an upper case letter, but inside the pages (which are the routes) we use a lower case letter.

`index.js` is the homepage.

`_api.js` is where everything starts. At the point `return <Component {...pageProps} />` is where routing starts. Alot can also be done before this done e.g. interaction with the server (checking if the user is logged in, ...)

`NB:` Referecing files and folders without considering their cases can slow or disable the hot reloading during delolopemnt. Make sure you reference the files and folders in their correct casing.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
